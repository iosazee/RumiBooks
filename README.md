## Description
This web application has a home page which serves as a landing page for users. There is a navbar with links to the other sections of the website, a main body and the footer.

Clicking on the category link on the navbar takes the user to the category index page, where they can see a list of all the book categories. This information is presented in a tabular format. There are columns for names of categories, updating a record and deleting a record, which contains buttons for those purposes. Just above the table is a button for creating a new category. Clicking on any of these buttons will take the user to the different pages where they can perform CRUD operations on the category table.

The final link on the navbar is the book expenses link. Clicking on this link takes the user to the book expense report page. Here, the user can see a bar chart of the total expenses for distributing each book category at a glance.

At the far end of the navbar is the search bar, where the user can perform search operations.
